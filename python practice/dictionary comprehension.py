value =  {}
for x in range(5):

# [expression for item in items]  #this is usually the format.

#items is our iterable 
#expression explains what it does..
#item is our loop variable

print(value)
print(value1)

# diff between set and dictionary is that dictionary has key value pai but sex just have numbers.
